    "\n",
    "Multi-size knapsack packing problem. Given a list of items L, where each item has a weight associated with it, the problem is to find a partition of the items into several subsets associated with multiple knapsacks, in such a way that the free space in the knapsacks is minimized. \n",
    "We will assume that we can use a finite number of sizes for the knapsacks (the list of allowed sizes/capacities should be provided as input).\n",
    "We will assume that we can use an arbitrary number of knapsacks of the same size."
